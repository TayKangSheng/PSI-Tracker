## Comments  
This project is a technical test for an Android Developer Job at Singapore Power.

### What have i learnt?
Every programming activity is a learning experience. 

1. Detailed planning before writing production codes is important. Building application is like making a product. Although I did drew out application flow using paper and pen. The entire planning process can be more detailed. The drawings and planning i made definitely helped in decision making during production. If more is done, the process could have been smoother. 

2. Application making does not end without multiple restructuring of codes. Some restructing can result in major changes, but it will all be worth it.

### What could have been done better.

1. Make sure all activity and fragments lifecycle is entirely in control. Only in this way, we can be sure that the entire project is well thought of, and thoroughly implemented.  
2. More Testing Driven Development. Production codes were written before testing codes, resulting in some ambiguity in the intent of some code blocks. Testing codes definitely make you ask yourself why some codes are written as such. Writing production codes with the testing perspective can make code structure cleaner and understandable. 
3. Restructuring! Codes got abit messy at the end, but i didn't had the time to make any major changes anymore. 
4. Design. UI/UX affects the entire outlook of the application. Maybe I should learn some color pairings or get someone to advice me on design of the interface. 

### Making it better.

The codes here are for all to use. If you want to work on it, go ahead. If you have any questions, email me at kangsheng@gmail.com.
